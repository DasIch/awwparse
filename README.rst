Awwparse -- because the command line needs love too
===================================================

This is an experiment in creating a usable alternative to argparse.
There is no documentation and the API is unstable which makes it unsuitable
for anything but small experiments. Due to the early stage don't expect pull
requests to be accepted as the design may still change.
