Awwparse -- because the command line needs love too
===================================================

This is an experiment in creating a usable alternative API to argparse.
There is no documentation and there are no tests so don't use it, yet. If you
still do for some reason don't come complaining unless you have a pull request
or it is embarassingly obvious.
